I spent quite a large portion of my formative programming years doing web development.
It has made me quite good at it, though I must confess that I wish I had spent time elsewhere.  

In late 2020, I was commissioned by one of the local print shops where I live to create a website
that would allow them to condense their **two** (and later three) poorly designed and managed websites
into one smooth and modern website. The goal was essentially to do a better shutterfly clone.
