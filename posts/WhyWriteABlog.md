## What is this blog about?

// haven't edited word by word yet.
I started this blog because I like to talk, but I don't like feeling like I don't understand what I'm talking about.
Many times in the middle of a conversation about something which I feel an amount of passion, I realize that I don't actually
know what I think I know about something, or if I do, I'm not saying it well. I would like to avoid that.
Because of that, this blog is going to be about everything under the sun. I plan on doing book reviews and
movie reviews, I will rant about things that bother me, I will attempt to explain concepts that I think are
interesting and important. My fondest hope is that I focus on writing a lot of well structured and helpful programming
articles. If you were looking for a homogeneous blog about a single topic, I'm sorry, you've come to the wrong place.

## Why am I writing a blog?

I have always been a voracious reader. When I was younger this took the form of fiction and fantasy. As I've gotten
older I have had a shift in what I read. I've increased my
consumtion of non-fiction and have realized that I need to write to organize my thoughts and remember what I read.
I often finish a book with questions and thoughts floating around in my head and I have understood that in order
to articulate my thoughts I need to write about them. 
I write a lot of code, but I don't think I write enough prose and my hope is that more writing in this style will
improve my code as well. 

I also tend to get frustrated about arbitrary things, and when I attempt to express my frustrations to those around me 
I am often unable to understand my own thoughts. 
My argmuments often feel shallow, and my conclusions selfish. 
I believe that as I write before I rant, that I will be able to explain myself in a simple and enjoyable way.
Because I will no longer be developing my thoughts in the middle of a conversation, this will
allow me to have better, more enjoyable, and more productive conversations with those around me.

## Why should you read my blog?

You don't have to. Implied in the last paragraph, this endeavor is almost entirely for myself. 
I believe it will be valuable to share my thoughts, and if someone has something to say, 
perhaps a useful discussion will ensue, but at the end of the day, I don't care if you read my blog.
I do think it will be worth your time though.
I have no monetary stake in this. Therefore, my thoughts and arguments on here will be what I honestly think.
I'm not going to lie or adjust to make an argument more convincing, or to say things that would be considered more popular.
Why would I? The purpose of this enterprise is for me to discover, and to share what I have discovered.
I believe that running this in an independant manner will generate the highest quality and most honest content possible.
